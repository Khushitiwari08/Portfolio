        <h2>Use Case Diagram</h2>
        <img src="assests/Use Case diagram.png"alt="Use case Diagram">
    
        <p> The use case diagram represents the main processes in Cab Booking system.
            Then they will be broken down into more specific use cases depending on
            the included processes of the main use case. Each of these use cases explains
            how the system handles the actions or scenarios requested by the user.</p>
        <p>The UML Use Case Diagram is a design used as one of the Methodology on
            Cab booking System development. It represents the main functions or
            processes of the system as well as the specific processes included. They
            were also labelled properly to guide programmers and users about the
            structure of Cab Booking System.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-individual">
        <h2>Communication Diagram</h2>
        <img src="assests/Communication diagram.png"alt="Use case Diagram">
    
        <p> The collaboration diagram is used to show the relationship between the objects
            in a system.</p>
        <p>Instead of showing the flow of messages, it depicts the architecture of the object
            residing in the system as it is based on object-oriented programming. An object
            consists of several features. Multiple objects present in the system are connected
            to each other. The collaboration diagram, which is also known as a
            communication diagram, is used to portray the object's architecture in the system.
            </p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-individual">
        <h2>Class Diagram</h2>
        <img src="assests/CLASS DIAGRAM (1).jpg"alt="Use case Diagram">
    
        <p>The Class diagram for Cab booking System shows the structures of information
            or data that will be handled in the system. These data or information will be
            represented by classes. Each of the classes will have their attributes in accord to
            the methods they will use.</p>
        <p>So the classes that must be made in Cab Booking System. The mentioned
            classes were just general. If you want more complex or wider scope of your
            Cab Booking system, then you can add your desired classes..</p>

        <h2>Deployment Diagram</h2>
        <img src="assests/Deployment diagram.png"alt="Use case Diagram">
    
        <p>The deployment diagram visualizes the physical hardware on which the
            software will be deployed. It portrays the static deployment view of a
            system. It involves the nodes and their relationships.</p>
            <p>
        It ascertains how software is deployed on the hardware. It maps the software
             architecture created in design to the physical system architecture, where the
            software will be executed as a node. Since it involves many nodes, the
             relationship is shown by utilizing communication paths..</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-individual">
        <h2>Activity Diagram</h2>
        <img src="assests/Activity Diagram.png"alt="Use case Diagram">
    
        <p>The UML activity Diagram is used to show the interaction of the user and the
            system. By creating it, youâ€™ll be able to see the flaws of the system and you may
            avoid it once you apply it to the project development. So it is important to have
            your diagrams designed first before jumping into its development.</p>
        <p>This illustration shows the activities and scenarios done when the User and
            Drivers access the system. The actions and decisions included were all
            emphasized here.</p>
    <div class="portfolio-individual">
        <h2>State Diagram</h2>
        <img src="assests/STATE DIAGRAM.jpg" alt="Use case Diagram">
    
        <p>The state machine diagram is also called the State chart or State Transition
            diagram, which shows the order of states underwent by an object within the
            system. It captures the software system's behaviour. It models the behaviour
            of a class, a subsystem, a package, and a complete system.</p>
            <p>It tends out to be an efficient way of modelling the interactions and
                collaborations in the external entities and the system. It models event-based
                systems to handle the state of an object. It also defines several distinct states
                of a component within the system. Each object/component has a specific
                state</p>
